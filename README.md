## *Stop planning. Start dating.*

### Wingmates is a portfolio project developed over the course of two weeks by three junior software engineers. It was inspired by a discussion of the extensive research required to plan a successful date. Wingmates will aggregate data about high quality venues, interesting events, directions, rideshare prices, weather, available deals, and much more into a single page format that makes planning a date simpler than ever. Dating should be an exciting adventure, not a chore. With Wingmates, partners can get back to the experiences that matter.
